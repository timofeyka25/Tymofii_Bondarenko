Feature: delete file

    Scenario: file should be deleted

        Given I upload file "<fileName>" in "<dir>"

        When I delete file "<fileName>" in "<dir>"

        Then there is no "<fileName>" in "<dir>"

        Examples:
            | fileName  | dir   |
            | image.png | /test |
