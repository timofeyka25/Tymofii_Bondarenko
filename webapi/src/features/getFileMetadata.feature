Feature: upload file with specific name

    Scenario: file should have defined name

        Given I upload "<fileName>" in "<dir>"

        When I get metadata of uploaded file

        Then uploaded file has "<fileName>" name

        Examples:
            | fileName  | dir   |
            | image.png | /test |
